# Midcampproject

##### This project is thought to be a first step in analyzing the relation between diffrent economic scenarios and assets. In particular: 

    ##### Growth measured by the GDP 
    ##### Inflation measured by the Consumer Prince Index
    ##### Stocks measured by the S&P 500
    ##### Bonds measured by the US Government Treasury Bond 10 Years
    ##### Cash measured by the US Government Treasure Bill 10 Years
    ##### Gold measured by the Gold Commodity Index
    
##### After collecting, cleaning and mergind data we arrived at the following conclussions: 

    ##### Stocks are linked with economic growht and show negative correlation with cpi
    ##### Bonds and cash yields are negatively correlated with economic growth and positively correlated with cpi
    ##### Gold is not correlated with CPI. Further analysis is needed in this asset to study his behaviour.
